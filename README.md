# Weekend jQuery Server-side Calculator

Thanks for looking into my Weekend Project, the jQuery Server-side Calculator for Prime Digital Academy!  


## Description

Duration: 3 Day Sprint

This is a web based app that interacts with a virtual server to run simple calculator functions.  The goal of this project was to get more hands on experience building an app that needs to communicate with a server via GET & POST routes.  


## Prerequisites

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ 

## Installation

To run this program, you will need to:
-- [] Run 'npm install' in your terminal. 
-- [] Run 'npm run server' in your terminal.


## Usage

To use this app, start the server in your terminal.  Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.  

Enter in a "First Number?" and a "Second Number?" input field, along with clicking the mathematical operator buttony you'd like to use in the equation. 

Click the "Equals" (=) button to run the equation, show the result, and add it to the list of prior equations.  Click the "Clear" button to clear the input fields.  

The equation history list will persist through page refreshes.  Start and stop the server to wipe the board. 


## Built With

JavaScript/HTML/CSS, jQuery, Node, Bootstrap, Ajax. 


## Thanks To

I'd like to give thanks to Dane and everyone in Pod 1 for helping me get through this week at Prime Digital Academy, which allowed me to understand more about Server GET & POST Routes, and were instrumental in me completing this assignment!
